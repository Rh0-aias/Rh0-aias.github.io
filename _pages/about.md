I am a fourth-year-graduate student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the [University of California Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/) under the supervision of Assistant Prof. Ran Cheng. I am now looking for a posdoctoral position and my research interests focus on the theory of condensed matter physics and spintronics. Echoing the words of an eminent physicist Philip W. Anderson, "You never understand everything.", I firmly embrace the notion that an endless expanse of knowledge still awaits for exploration, continuously propelling me to forward on the path of academia with passion and curiosity.
