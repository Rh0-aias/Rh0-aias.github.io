<p align="justify">
I am a fifth-year-graduate student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of California Riverside under the supervision of Assistant Prof. Ran Cheng. I am now looking for a postdoctoral position. My research interests focus on the theory of condensed matter physics and spintronics. I am also very interested on studying the novel transport phenomenon in magnetic topological material. 
  
Echoing the words of an eminent physicist Philip W. Anderson, "You never understand everything", I firmly embrace the fact that an endless expanse of knowledge still awaits for exploration, which continuously encourages me to forward on the path of academia with passion and curiosity.
